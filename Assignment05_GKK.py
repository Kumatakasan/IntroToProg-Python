# Title: Assignment 05
# Description: Working with Dictionaries and Files
#              When the program starts, load each "row" of data
#              in "ToDoToDoList.txt" into a python Dictionary.
#              Add the each dictionary "row" to a python list "table"
# ChangeLog (Who,When,What):
# RRoot,1.1.2030,Created started script
# GKumataka, 08.07.2021 started work on loading data
# GKumataka, 08.08.2021 Finished all options and commented code
# GKumataka, 08.09.2021 Changed how I imported original file
